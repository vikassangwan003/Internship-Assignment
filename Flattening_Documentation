def fun(Lis):
    res = []
    for i in Lis:
        if type(i) is int:
            res.append(i)
        else:
            res += fun(i)
    return res

x = [[1, 2, [3]], 4]
print(fun(x))

For Flattening the list I created a function.
      In that function created an empty list "res"
      and executed a loop if  the list passed in function contains single integer then it is appended to newly created list ie "res"
      and if list contain another list then function is calling itself ie, Recursive Calling and then also if that sublist contain single integer 
      then added to "res" list.
